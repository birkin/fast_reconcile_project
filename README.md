#### overview

this readme will be updated, but in a nutshell, this'll be a [django](https://www.djangoproject.com)/python3 version of Ted Lawless' [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)/python2 [fast-reconcile project](https://github.com/lawlesst/fast-reconcile), which, his readme says, is based on a demo [reconcilliation service](https://github.com/mikejs/reconcile-demo) by Michael Stevens.

Plus, there'll be tweaks based on requests from [Brown Library](https://library.brown.edu) staff.

I've also been pointed to good work by [Christina Harlow](https://github.com/cmh2166), who has built similar services for id.loc.gov (lcsh, lcnaf, etc.) and geonames.
